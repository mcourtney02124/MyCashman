This is my version of the "cashman" application described at
https://auth0.com/blog/developing-restful-apis-with-python-and-flask/#bootstrapping-flask

It is a flask application for experimenting with REST API, pytest, 
and Tavern.

Not using the Docker stuff at present, it will need serious 
rework when I come back to it - use "bootstrap_local.sh" for now.
